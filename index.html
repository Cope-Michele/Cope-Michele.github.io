            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p class="about-me-essay"> I was born in Southern California and grew up in Idaho, I currently live in Utah with my husband. I love the western United States and the beauty that surrounds me. I love hiking, camping and just being outside. I also love stories and learning new things about the world I live in. I once read a quote by Neil Gaiman, that truly inspired me and put into words the hope I have for the future, it said;<br/>

            <p class="about-me-essay" id="important">"Fairy tales are more than true, not because they tell us that dragons exist but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten."</p>

            <p class="about-me-essay">My great joy in life is my family, my husband is my best friend and my daughter is my first real masterpiece. I love exploring the world with them and watching and helping my daughter learn about the wonderful planet we live on. The joy and wonder of her little imagination inspires me, my greatest desire is to help her hold on to her imagination as she grows older, I know the world would have her stamp it out. The world has enough darkness in it, I want to make a difference in that! I will always strive to inspire and uplift others through my art. Just like with my daughter, I hope my work can bring out the imagination in others who may stumble upon it.</p>

        <p class="gallery-info">The buttons above will direct you to different galleries displaying my pieces in each related field. Throughout my life I have had the opportunity to study and experiment with many different artistic mediums and materials. These range from 2D exploration in drawing and painting in watercolor, acrylics and oils to 3D studies in clay, pot throwing, basket weaving, carving in stone and wood oragami and designing paper sculptures. I have also had the opportunity to learn about and practice graphic and web design. I've served on yearbook and newspaper staff's as well as had the opportunity to do some professional projects for a retail shopping center. </p>
        <p class="gallery-info">My galleries are subject to change often and I will constantly be updating information on old projects and also adding new ones! So please check back often to see what I have been up to! If you would like to contact me about any of the projects I have worked on or about a work opportunity, please visit the contact page.</p>
