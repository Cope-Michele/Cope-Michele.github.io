            <p> I was born in Southern California and grew up in Idaho, I currently live in Utah with my husband. I love the western United States and the beauty that surrounds me. I love hiking, camping and just being outside. I also love stories and learning new things about the world I live in. I once read a quote by Neil Gaiman, that truly inspired me and put into words the hope I have for the future, it said;<br/>

            <quote id="important">"Fairy tales are more than true, not because they tell us that dragons exist but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten."</quote>

            <p>My great joy in life is my family, my husband is my best friend and my daughter is my first real masterpiece. I love exploring the world with them and watching and helping my daughter learn about the wonderful planet we live on. The joy and wonder of her little imagination inspires me, my greatest desire is to help her hold on to her imagination as she grows older, I know the world would have her stamp it out. The world has enough darkness in it, I want to make a difference in that! I will always strive to inspire and uplift others through my art. Just like with my daughter, I hope my work can bring out the imagination in others who may stumble upon it.</p>
