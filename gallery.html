        <p id="gallery-info">The buttons above will direct you to different galleries displaying my pieces in each related field. Throughout my life I have had the opportunity to study and experiment with many different artistic mediums and materials. These range from 2D exploration in drawing and painting in watercolor, acrylics and oils to 3D studies in clay, pot throwing, basket weaving, carving in stone and wood oragami and designing paper sculptures. I have also had the opportunity to learn about and practice graphic and web design. I've served on yearbook and newspaper staff's as well as had the opportunity to do some professional projects for a retail shopping center. </p>
        <p id="gallery-info">My galleries are subject to change often and I will constantly be updating information on old projects and also adding new ones! So please check back often to see what I have been up to! If you would like to contact me about any of the projects I have worked on or about a work opportunity, please visit the contact page.</p>
