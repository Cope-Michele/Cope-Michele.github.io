                    <p>This week I also taught about CSS transitions and animations, I picked up where Kelly left off last week.</p>
            
                    <p>ADD REFLECTION</p>
            
                <h3>Lesson 2</h3>

                    <p>This week we were separated into our groups and started to get organized. We set up a group Google Community, a Github repository, and our Google Drive where our group would keep all of our documents. We also briefly discussed our elevator pitches and started narrowing down our choices for our group project. It is hard for me to say that I have ever had a group project in college that I thought was successful or enjoyable. I feel as an online student the normal issues that crop up in group projects are elevated and more problematic, so I must admit that I have some apprehension when I think about how this project will go this semester.</p>

                    <p>That being said, I think it is important to try and keep our project simplified. It will likely not be simple to execute, and our team will need to be as organized as possible to pull this off, so a simplified project will help us keep things organized I believe. There are some members of our team that have not communicated, and so we are wondering if they have dropped the class. I'm pleased that the members of my group who have been communicating seem to be dedicated to being responsible and helpful teammates. Always a good thing! This makes me feel that we are off to a good start, if we keep communicating than I think we will be able to pull this project off this semester without giving ourselves to many headaches!</p>

                    <p>We had our second class meeting yesterday and talked about CSS Transitions. Kelly taught this week which started around 14:50. I feel I equally contributed to this discussion and asked questions throughout the meeting (16:30). We also showed each other our elevator pitches, I started my pitch around ( 24:15).</p>

                    <p>My sandbox code for this week can be found in my personal github repository for this class. I played around with creating checkboxes in CSS and using transitions within the checkboxes to make them more unique.</p>
            
                <h3>Lesson 1</h3>

                    <p>This week we started CIT 261. I'm a little nervous for this class. I don't feel like I've had many group projects in school that have actually felt like they were beneficial to me. I'll do my best to be a good team player, I hope my fellow teammates will do the same.</p>
            
                    <p>This week we worked on getting everything set up so that we are ready to start splitting into groups next week. I've already got my Github and code editor linked to the class repository I've set up for myself for this class. We will be doing a lot of communication with Google + this semester which will be interesting, hopefully its not more confusing to have a third site to look to for information regarding classes. Here we go!</p>
